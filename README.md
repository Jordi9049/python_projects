## Main Project: HR Retention Analysis

### Overview
The HR Retention Analysis project is the centerpiece of this repository. It involves analyzing employee retention data to uncover actionable insights and trends using Machine Learning algorithims. This project demonstrates my ability to work with real-world datasets, clean and preprocess data, perform exploratory data analysis (EDA), build predictive models, and create compelling visualizations.

### Key Skills Demonstrated
- Data cleaning and preprocessing.
- Exploratory data analysis (EDA) using Python.
- Predictive modeling with machine learning.
- Data visualization to communicate insights effectively.
- Documentation and reproducibility of analysis.
